v3.2
gopro_2027 ordered 20 of this board version on 4/19/2025 at a cost of $270, reselling in discord

Changes:
Swapped out acc read circuit with Zener diode circuit
Changed the compressor diode thing to go to VCC (12v) instead of whatever it was before... This fixes the circuitry for something i don't remember exactly
Added 8 pin connector for the amazon pressure sensor kit in case you don't want to cut the wires and re-pin them again.
Changed fuse to standard car fuse

Please see the readme inside the JLCPCB_ORDER folder of the v3.1 for how to order properly or order from a reseller on the discord
