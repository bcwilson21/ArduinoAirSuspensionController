### Manifold Parts

| Part Name  | qty | Link | info |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Generic Ebay Manifold | 1 | https://www.ebay.com/itm/324238773355 | All the documentation is based on this manifold and it's wiring. If you use a different manifold you need to follow the wiring diagrams on the PCB carefully |
| 200PSI pressure sensor | 5 | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYHW1R2Z | This is a kit, we will not be using the screen, but it is cheaper than buying individually and more reliable than purchasing the sensors from a random supplier, as they often end up being duds. This kit also includes plenty of wiring, eliminating the need to purchase more wiring for the pressure sensors |
| Various 1/8 NPT PTC connectors | 0-12 | - | Depending on your setup you may configure the ports differently. Easiest route is using all PTC and 1/4" hoses to everything |
| 3D printed manifold base hat and lid | 1 | - | You are going to want to 3d print the files for assembling the manifold and pcb together in a nice package. If you don't own a 3d printer, you will want to order these files printed online or from one of the discord members |

### Additional Parts

| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Relay | 2 | https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T35K8S2 | You will likely want to have a main relay to run the 12v wiring from, just like any other aftermarket accessory component on a vehicle. You also may want a relay to control the compressor (Please double check your requirements for the compressor relay and amps!!!!! Requirements vary depending on your compressor setup, which is out of the scope of OAS-Man. OAS-Man only supplies the signal of when to turn on the compressor, not the full power.) |
