# Parts list

Here are the parts required to build the manifold. Obviously with an open source and customizable system, there is room for changes. This is also not intended to include other air suspension components necessary to build the rest of the system, and some may overlap between the manifold and rest of the system and be a bit outside the scope of this project (eg. the connectors you attach to the manifold could vary greatly), so use your best judgement.

### Manifold Parts

| Part Name  | qty | image | Link | info |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Generic Ebay Manifold | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d73bb078-ae31-4118-87ea-b4fd3c6de5ba) | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/324238773355) | All the documentation is based on this manifold and it's wiring. If you use a different manifold you need to follow the wiring diagrams on the PCB carefully |
| 22 Gauge 4 or 5 Conductor Electrical Wire | 10ft+ | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6ff4300-0bce-49bf-948e-1de7f52de4c5) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFJXMDT3?smid=A6X70Q6OCPVWR&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp&th=1) | You need 4 wires to handle 12v, ground, acc, and compressor, or you can get 5 wire bundle if you want to drive the compressor positive wire separately (not required, as it can share the +12v wire) |
| 200PSI pressure sensor | 5 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a231e73f-f6e8-48e3-80ee-d0554a466072) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYHW1R2Z) | This is a kit, we will not be using the screen, but it is cheaper than buying individually and more reliable than purchasing the sensors from a random supplier, as they often end up being duds. This kit also includes plenty of wiring, eliminating the need to purchase more wiring for the pressure sensors |
| Various 1/8 NPT PTC connectors | 0-12 | - | - | Depending on your setup you may configure the ports differently. Easiest route is using all PTC and 1/4" hoses to everything |
| 3D printed manifold base hat and lid | 1 | - | - | You are going to want to 3d print the files for assembling the manifold and pcb together in a nice package. If you don't own a 3d printer, you will want to order these files printed online or from one of the discord members |
| Main PCB | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05903a94-f99a-4bc5-8a4f-212cf436e3cb) | [files](/PCB/ESP32_30PIN_PCB/) | Order the pcb from jlcpcb (or whatever you prefer) in the minimum quantity of 5 (about $30) or purchase one from a discord member. More info on the other tutorial pages. |
| 12V Stabilizer | 1 | ![20241205_131439](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77595e2d-b98f-428d-9c74-689fca6c2d4f) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/YABOANG-9-40V-12V3A-Transformer-Instruments/dp/B0CZ8GYJC5?th=1) | Car electronics are not a perfect 12v, would be a good idea to run one of these on the 12v input to stabilize the voltage and help prevent possible issues |

### Additional Parts

| Part Name  | qty | image | Link | info |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Relay | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d14dc4ea-0366-496f-81c5-a614b326eb65) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T35K8S2) | You also may want a relay to control the compressor (Please double check your requirements for the compressor relay and amps!!!!! Requirements vary depending on your compressor setup, which is out of the scope of OAS-Man. OAS-Man only supplies the signal of when to turn on the compressor, not the full power.) |
