### Controller assembly
Not much assembly required.<br>
Print out the case in a material like PETG. I recommend using a carbon fiber texture board personally for aesthetics.<br>
Purchase your ESP32-2432S032C and battery. If you get the wrong cable on the battery, my ESP32-2432S032C came with the correct battery cable so yours probably will too. Solder that one on.<br>
You can use double sided tape to attach the battery to the back panel of the case or to the back of the board.<br>
Screw the case on with M3 screws.<br>
