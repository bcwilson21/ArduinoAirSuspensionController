# Manifold Assemmbly

Get the 3d prints to print from [here](/3d%20Prints)<br>
Print them in a plastic with medium-high heat resistance such as PETG or ABS<br>
<br>
You can attach the screen to the 3d print with m2 screws.<br>
You can attach the board to the 3d print with m3 screws. Note that one of the screw holes was placed too close to the circuitry, so only use 3 screws.<br>
<br>
On the manifold:<br>port 1 goes to front passenger (right)<br>port 2 goes to rear passenger (right)<br>port 3 goes to front driver (left)<br>port 4 goes to rear driver (left)<br>
The ports on the opposite side will correspond to the pressure sensors for the same bags.<br>
Please see the annotated diagram for a full breakdownL<br>
