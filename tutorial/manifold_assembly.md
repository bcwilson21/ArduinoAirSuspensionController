# Manifold Assemmbly

Get the 3d prints to print from [here](/3d%20Prints)<br>
Print them in a plastic with medium-high heat resistance such as PETG or ABS<br>
Print the lid upside down.<br>
For the hat please choose the version with or without the screen. Print upright<br>
The base prints upright<br>
<br>
You can attach the screen to the 3d print with m2 screws. More info below.<br>
You can attach the board to the 3d print with m3 screws. Note that one of the screw holes was placed too close to 2 of the resistors on the top left accidentally, but they are connected there so it is fine to have them touch.<br>
<br>
On the manifold:<br>port 1 goes to front passenger (right)<br>port 2 goes to rear passenger (right)<br>port 3 goes to front driver (left)<br>port 4 goes to rear driver (left)<br>
The ports on the opposite side will correspond to the pressure sensors for the same bags.<br>
Please see the annotated diagram for a full breakdown<br>

If you intend to utilize the built in lcd screen, follow these instructions:<br>
Solder the 4 wires and jst connector properly so that the wire names match the board.<br>
Loosely snug down the screen to the manifold, emphasis on loosely! Just barely snug. The screens are very fragile, particularly on the lower 2 corners of the screen.<br>
Once the screen is positioned, put some dabs of super blue on the inside nuts to hold it in place.<br>
